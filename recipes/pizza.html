        <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
        <p>A recipe for Pizza from the website Allrecepies. This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
        <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Bread Flour</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
            <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
